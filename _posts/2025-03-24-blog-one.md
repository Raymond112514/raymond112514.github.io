### Empirical Risk Minimization

In a standard supervised learning setup, we are given two space $\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}$ and the goal is to learn a function $f\in \mathcal{F}$ that predicts $y\in \mathcal{Y}$ given $x\in \mathcal{X}$. This can be done through solving the optimization problem:

$$f^*=\text{argmin}_{f\in \mathcal{F}} \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{X, Y\sim \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}} [\ell(f(X), Y)]}_{R(f)}$$

Where $\ell:\mathcal{Y}\times \mathcal{Y}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called the loss function and measures the error between the estimate $f(X)$ and the ground truth $Y$ and the $R(f)$ is called the risk of $f$. Putting the optimization problem in words, we want to find a function such that the average error is low. Solving this problem is practice poses two challenges:

1. It's hard to optimize over the space of functions $\mathcal{F}$, and
2. Even evaluating the objective $R(f)$ requires performing integration over high dimensional space, which is hard. 

The first problem is easy to solve: we just consider a parameterized family of function $\{f_\theta:\theta\in \Theta\}$. Now we can use algorithms like gradient descent to find the optimal parameter. To solve the second problem, instead of optimizing over the expectation, we estimate the expectation using sample averages. In other words, we instead solve the following optimization problem 

$$\hat{f}=\text{argmin}_{f\in \mathcal{F}} \underbrace{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ell(f(X_i), Y_i)}_{\hat{R}_n(f)}$$

Where $\{(X_i, Y_i)\}_{i\in [n]}$, sometimes called the training set, are i.i.d. samples from $\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$. We call the $\hat{R}_n(f)$ term the empiricial risk on $f$. Since $\hat{f}$ is the minimizer on the dataset $\mathcal{D}=\{(X_i, Y_i)\}_{i\in [n]}$, we know that the average risk of $\hat{f}$, but what we actually want is low risk on the set $\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}$.
