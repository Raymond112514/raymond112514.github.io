I really enjoy teaching. I love that every time I come back to the same material, I always gain new insights on how to understand a concept or solve a problem differently! Below, I've listed some of my teaching experiences.

##### CS70: Discrete Math and Probability
* Summer 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024, Summer 2024: Reader/Tutor
* Fall 2024: TA, overall teaching effective rating 6.54, with department average 6.21. 
* Spring 2025: TA

##### MATH H104: Honors Real Analysis
* Fall 2023: Reader

For my CS70 discussion section, I also prepared slides during the discussions (since I'm a slow writer). The slides for each section are posted below. Note that this counts as unofficial course material, so if you are a CS70 student, please use the official notes and lectures as the only reliable source of truth. There might be some typos on the slides, and some animations could cause the formatting to look off...
